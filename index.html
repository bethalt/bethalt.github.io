<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<br>
<p>
The course exposes students - through experience and timely readings - to the latest in research and practice on how to approach professional multi-disciplinary creative problem solving.
</p>
<p>
Students gain direct experience overcoming many of the under-represented challenges of becoming an innovator: identifying opportunities big enough to pursue, leading team projects under realistic entrepreneurial conditions, and building a coalition of support to scale their ideas.
</p>
<p>
<h3>New Developments for 2015</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Instead of one semester-long project as we've done in the past, I have added a skill-building crash course in the first month, in which students do immersive fieldwork (similar to human centered design or design thinking) and analysis to identify innovation opportunities related to: how technology is changing what it means to be human. In this period, students quickly develop the skills they need for their personal projects. </li>
  <li>After this phase, students either choose to deepen their work on this topic, or to apply their fieldwork skills to their own interest areas, increasingly taking more ownership over their projects.</li>
  <li>Soon after, both tracks begin prototyping and developing their demos soon after, with course and lab support.</li>
  <li>Recognizing that students have different goals coming into a course like this, I have added multiple tracks that you can pursue, depending on your individual goals.</li>
  <li>Students in the past spent a lot of time early on figuring out how to get their work done collectively. This year I have integrated professional workflows and decision-making templates to speed your group progress, so the focus is on skills, idea development, and professionalism.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Student Experience</h3>
In this class, students learn to: identify important unmet needs through behavioral fieldwork, work effectively with others to develop and prototype potential solutions, and lead innovative projects to implementation. They learn ethnographic and design processes (observing, interpreting, ideating, testing, refining, planning) for identifying needs, and practice applying insights from industry and research (e.g., negotiate, strategize, motivate others, and build support) to move their ideas through organizational and political systems.
</p>
<p>
Students get tailored individual feedback on research-based factors linked to effective multi-disciplinary innovation at multiple levels (individual, team, cross-team/class) designed to help prepare them for intra- and entrepreneurial work in the future.
</p>
<p>
The course features occasional guest speakers from industry and academia, and involves collaborating with cutting-edge companies.
