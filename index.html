<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<br>
<p>
The course exposes students - through experience and timely readings - to the latest in research and practice on practical ways to approach professional multi-disciplinary creative problem solving and innovation. Students learn and apply various methods, and explore which ones work best for them.
</p>
<p>
In the process, they gain direct experience overcoming many of the common product development and interpersonal management pitfalls that researchers have identified as leading to failure in innovation projects. A few examples of these include: deciding what is important and maintaining your motivation to make implement your ideas, managing collaborative team projects under realistic and uncertain entrepreneurial conditions, designing things that acutally solve a problem and that people want, and building a coalition of support to scale your ideas.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Student Experience</h3>
<ul>
<b>Core Skills:</b> 
 <li>Identify important unmet needs through behavioral fieldwork and mixed-method analysis</li>
  <li>Work effectively with others to develop and prototype potential solutions</li>
  <li>Lead innovative projects to implementation</li>
  <li>Ethnographic and design processes (observing, interpreting, ideating, testing, refining, planning) for identifying unmet needs</li>
  <li>Apply insights from industry and research to move their ideas through organizational and political systems (e.g., negotiate, strategize, motivate others, and build support).</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Research-based Feedback:</b> 
The class features an extensive feedback system for personalized education. Each student receives ongoing feedback and an in-depth end-of-term analysis of their professional development as it compares to key factors that researchers have linked to successful multi-disciplinary innovation. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Industry Interaction:</b> 
The course features occasional guest speakers from industry and academia, and involves collaborating with cutting-edge companies. Linked to the course, in 2016 I will run an informal, optional monthly speaker series called AI Kitchen at Leverett House where I invite professionals to discuss how to design more desirable and inclusive technology and algorithms.

<h3>New Developments for 2015-16</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Instead of one semester-long project as we've done in the past, I have added a skill-building crash course in the first month. Students then take on a practice project with industry mentors. In this period, students quickly develop the skills they need to pursue their personal projects in the second half of the class. </li>
  <li>After the practice project phase, students either choose to deepen their work on this topic, or to apply their fieldwork skills to their own interest areas, increasingly taking more ownership over their projects.</li>
  <li>Soon after, both tracks begin prototyping and developing their demos, with course and lab support.</li>
  <li>Recognizing that students have different goals coming into a course like this, I have added multiple tracks that you can pursue, depending on your individual goals.</li>
  <li>Students in the past spent a lot of time early on figuring out how to get their work done collectively. This year I have integrated professional workflows and decision-making templates to speed your group progress, so the focus is on skills, idea development, and professionalism.</li>
</ul>
